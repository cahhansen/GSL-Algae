# GSL-Algae

#### Background
Utah has experienced several major algal blooms in a number of lakes and reservoirs in recent years (especially in heavily recreated areas near urban centers of Salt Lake City - Provo), which have raised concerns over water quality conditions. Remote sensing provides a number of potential tools for better understanding and monitoring surface water quality conditions.

#### Purpose
This repository is a collection of the scripts used in Google Earth Engine and R for processing, model development, and analysis of algal blooms using remote sensing.
